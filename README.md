# OldPasswordManager

This is a project I worked on after I completed my first semester in college. It is a personal use password manager, and does not connect to the web. It can be compiled for both windows and Linux. My plans are to develop a full password manager that will work over the network, and on mobile phones. User authentication and security will be taken more seriously (now that I've worked with it), and the program will have a full graphical user interface.

Written in C, the program will store information such as the name of the account, usernames, passwords, the name on the account, the birth-date on the account, and the number on the account. Plans to add two-factor authentication were in place, but ultimately I was the only one who used the program, and it didn't seem necessary. This isn't a question for my future password manager, though.
